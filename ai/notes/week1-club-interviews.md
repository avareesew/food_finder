## Interview 1 — Kendall Castlelaw
**Past Finance Society President · Marriott School of Business (Tanner Building)**  
**Date:** 2026-02-24

### Q: How do you currently promote events?

- **Digital screens** throughout the Tanner Building
- **Newsletter** distributed to all freshmen (Marriott School)
- **Instagram accounts** tied to the Tanner Building (Marriott policy-managed)
- **In-class announcements** — go into prerequisite classes to announce events directly
- **⚠️ No physical flyers in Tanner** — you get in trouble for distributing flyers at the Tanner unless it is a large, Marriott-wide event (Marriott School policy)

### Q: How often did you order food for events?

- Finance Society ordered food for **every event**
- Companies would frequently **sponsor the food** (~80% of events were company-sponsored)

### Q: What happens to leftovers?

- Usually taken home — *"take home a pizza for your roommates"*
- Very rarely did they have food that students didn't grab — demand was typically high at their events

### Q: Would you use a platform to post leftover food?

- **Main barrier:** Wanting to give food to students who came to the event. The food is paid for by Finance Society dues-paying members, so the preference is to serve members first.
- Not opposed to others coming, but the dynamic is: *"this is for students that came to our event"*
- Open to it if framing is right — **"any exposure is good exposure"**; fine with non-members showing up for food if they're willing to sit through the event

### Q: What concerns would you have about liability / safety?

- No concerns raised. Covered by the exposure comment above — happy for anyone to attend.

## Key Insights & Implications

### 🚨 Critical Finding: Tanner Building is digital-first, not flyer-first
The Marriott School of Business prohibits physical flyer distribution in the Tanner Building except for large, school-wide events. Promotion there runs through **digital screens, Instagram, and newsletters** — not bulletin board flyers. This directly challenges the assumption that 70%+ of BYU club events are promoted via physical flyers.

**Impact on roadmap assumption:**
- "BYU clubs print physical flyers" may be false for the Marriott School cluster entirely
- Need to validate whether this policy is isolated to Tanner or applies more broadly
- The AI flyer-scanning pipeline may have lower supply from one of campus's largest club ecosystems

**Suggested action:** In the flyer survey (Task 0.2.1), specifically note how many flyers come from Marriott vs. other buildings. If Tanner is empty of flyers, pivot toward digital/manual entry for that segment.

---

### 💡 Supply-Side Motivation is More Nuanced Than Expected
The assumption was that organizers want to reduce waste and will gladly post leftovers. The reality is subtler: **organizers feel a primary obligation to their own members** (who funded the food via dues). Posting publicly feels like diverting a member benefit to outsiders.

**The opening:** Kendall noted "any exposure is good exposure" — meaning posting works if it's framed as recruitment/event promotion, not just waste reduction. Framing it as *"get people in the door"* rather than *"give away your leftovers"* may be more effective for this persona.

**Impact on PRD:** The Club Recruiter persona should emphasize attendance and club visibility, not just waste reduction. The "bring food, attract future members" angle resonates more than the sustainability angle for this user.

---

### ✅ Liability Concern Validated as Low
No concerns raised. Aligns with the 2023 FDIA positioning in the PRD. The legal shield framing is confirmed as a non-issue for at least this persona.

---

### 📊 Food Frequency Data Point
80% of Finance Society events had company-sponsored food. This is a strong signal that food events are common — but it also means the food "belonged" to a sponsor, which may add another layer to liability framing (sponsor's food, not the club's).

## Interview 2 — Carson Fellows
**Current Management Consulting Club President**
**Date:** 2026-02-25

### Q: How do you currently promote events?

- **Email** — PDF attachment sent to members; food is mentioned in the email
- **Digital TVs** throughout their building
- **Professor outreach** — ask professors to announce events in class
- **Cross-club outreach** — reach out to Women in Finance, STEM business clubs to share events
- **Food mentioned on flyers/emails** — they do call out food as a draw
- *Notable: Carson mentions "flyers" in the context of food announcements — suggests this club does use some form of physical or digital flyer, unlike Tanner*

### Q: What happens to leftovers?

- **Rarely has leftovers** — intentionally orders less than needed
- If any remains, someone in the presidency takes it home

### Q: Would you use a platform to post leftover food?

- **Wouldn't go out of their way** to post it on their own
- **But:** if it got more people to attend the club event, *"then maybe"* — the recruitment framing resonates here too
- *"Sure, no harm in it"* — no opposition, just low spontaneous motivation

### Q: What concerns would you have about liability / safety?

- Couldn't think of any. No concerns raised.

### ⚠️ New Finding: Leftover Supply May Be Lower Than Assumed
Carson orders *less than needed* — meaning their events rarely produce leftovers at all. This is a different problem than Kendall (demand consumed supply); here the supply is preemptively kept low. Both interviews converge on the same outcome: **reliable leftover supply is not guaranteed**.

**Impact:** The feed may need to be seeded with events that have food available during (not just after) the event, not only post-event scraps.

---

### 💡 Supply-Side Motivation is More Nuanced Than Expected
The assumption was that organizers want to reduce waste and will gladly post leftovers. The reality is subtler: **organizers feel a primary obligation to their own members** (who funded the food via dues). Posting publicly feels like diverting a member benefit to outsiders.

**Consistent across both interviews:** Motivation to post is tied to **recruitment and visibility**, not waste reduction. Framing as "get people in the door" outperforms "reduce food waste."

**Impact on PRD:** The Club Recruiter persona should emphasize attendance and club visibility, not just waste reduction. The "bring food, attract future members" angle resonates more than the sustainability angle for this user.

---

### ✅ Liability Concern Validated as Non-Issue (2/2)
Neither interview raised liability concerns. Carson couldn't think of any. Aligns with the 2023 FDIA positioning in the PRD. Confirmed across two independent data points.

---

### 📊 Food Frequency Data Point
80% of Finance Society events had company-sponsored food. Management Consulting orders food but conservatively. Both clubs have food at events — but frequency of *leftovers* is lower than expected.

---

## Emerging Questions for Follow-Up Interviews

1. Is the no-flyers policy specific to Tanner / Marriott School, or does it apply to other buildings (TMCB, WSC, Talmage)?
2. For clubs that DO have leftover food, what's the typical window between "event ends" and "food is thrown away"? (Informs how fast the feed needs to surface posts.)
3. Would organizers be willing to post DURING an event (e.g., "come to the second half, food still available") vs. only after?
4. How do non-Marriott clubs (CS, Pre-Med, RAs) promote? Do they use physical flyers?

## Running Tally

| Assumption | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Physical flyers are primary input | ⚠️ At Risk | Tanner is mostly digital — non-Tanner unknown, both interviews were Tanner-affiliated |
| Leftover supply is reliable | ⚠️ At Risk | Both interviewees rarely have leftovers; Carson orders conservatively |
| Organizers will post leftovers willingly | ⚠️ Nuanced | Won't go out of their way; recruitment framing unlocks motivation (2/2) |
| Liability is a blocker | ✅ Falsified | Zero concerns raised — confirmed across 2 independent interviews |
| Food events are frequent | ✅ Confirmed | Both clubs have food at events regularly |
| Students will browse without login | ○ Not yet validated | — |
| Gemini accuracy 80%+ | ○ Not yet tested | — |
