# AI Working Space

This folder contains temporary working artifacts and is **gitignored**.

## Structure

- `guides/` - Library documentation, research output, external references
- `roadmaps/` - Task checklists, sprint plans, WIP tracking
- `notes/` - Brainstorming, quick notes, scratch work

## Usage

Feel free to add any working files here without worrying about git. This is your local workspace for organizing thoughts and tasks.

**Note:** Important decisions and documentation should be moved to `aiDocs/` (which is tracked in git).
