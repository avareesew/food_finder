## [Unreleased]

### In Progress
- Created `ai/roadmaps/phase-2-through-4-checklist.md` to track roadmap tasks + status for Phase 2/3/4 work items.
- Added `src/lib/logger.ts` and wired structured logging through the upload API, Firestore services, feed page, and upload form so debuggable events are emitted during every flow.
- Extended `scripts/test.sh` to lint/build, pipe output into `logs/test-<timestamp>.log`, and documented how to replay the structured logs in `aiDocs/context.md`.
- Expanded `aiDocs/prd.md` with Customer Focus, Differentiation, and Success/Failure Criteria sections to show Jason our due diligence, metrics, and pivot plans.
- Drafted the customer interaction plan (below) so we can capture at least five touchpoints or falsification experiments and log the learnings in the changelog once complete.

### Customer Discovery

#### ✅ Completed — Interview 1: Kendall Castellaw (2026-02-24)
**Past Finance Society President · Marriott School (Tanner Building)**
Full notes: `ai/notes/week1-club-interviews.md`

Key findings:
- **🚨 Tanner Building is flyer-free by policy.** Marriott School prohibits physical flyer distribution except for large school-wide events. Clubs in Tanner use digital screens, Instagram, and newsletters instead. Puts the “70%+ of events have physical flyers” assumption at risk for the Marriott cluster.
- **Supply-side motivation is nuanced.** Food is funded by member dues, so the instinct is to serve members first. The effective pitch is event *exposure and recruitment* (“get people in the door”), not waste reduction.
- **Liability is a non-issue.** Confirmed: no concerns raised. Validates FDIA framing is sufficient.
- **Food events are frequent.** Every Finance Society event had food; ~80% was company-sponsored.

#### ✅ Completed — Interview 2: Carson Fellows (2026-02-25)
**Current Management Consulting Club President**
Full notes: `ai/notes/week1-club-interviews.md`

Key findings:
- **Non-Tanner clubs do use flyers/email with food callouts.** Carson mentions announcing food on flyers and in emails — partially rehabilitates the flyer-scanning assumption for buildings outside Marriott School.
- **Leftover supply is lower than expected.** Management Consulting intentionally orders less than needed; rarely has leftovers. Both interviews now converge on low/unreliable leftover supply. Feed may need to surface food-available-during-event posts, not just post-event scraps.
- **Recruitment framing confirmed across two independent interviews.** “If it got more people to go to the club, then maybe” — same motivation as Kendall. Waste reduction framing does not resonate; club growth does.
- **Liability: zero concerns** — second independent confirmation. FDIA positioning is sufficient.
- **Low spontaneous posting motivation.** “Wouldn’t go out of their way to post it.” Friction reduction is critical — posting must be near-effortless or supply side won’t participate.

#### Planned Touchpoints (Remaining)
- Interview/ride-along with RA Marcus (Heritage Halls) to validate sustainability messaging and interest in raising floors’ awareness.
- Chat with club recruiter Sarah (Marketing Club) to see how leftover catering is currently handled and confirm the legal/procedural blockers.
- Survey 5+ hungry students in the JFSB or library (Hungry Hustler persona) about their current food discovery channels and willingness to use a feed.
- Interview a campus sustainability advocate about measurable waste metrics to feed into our success criteria dashboards.
- Run a falsifiability check by asking 5 random students whether they would post leftovers anonymously and capturing yes/no plus rationale.

### Testing & Logs
- `bash scripts/test.sh` now runs lint + `next build --webpack`, pipes structured output into `logs/test-<timestamp>.log`, and is referenced in `aiDocs/context.md` for reproducing the test-log-fix loop.
- `logs/test-20260223-205538.log` captured the first failure (TurbopackInternalError: creating new process / binding to a port) so we could justify moving to webpack builds.
- `logs/test-20260223-210044.log` captured the `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND fonts.googleapis.com` errors from the webpack run; the fix was removing the `next/font` imports and defining font CSS variables locally.
- `logs/test-20260223-210144.log` proves the updated pipeline succeeded (lint + webpack build), so we can show Casey the structured logs plus the CLI commands that produced them.

- ✅ MVP Demo Specification (2-3 week build timeline)
- ✅ System architecture document (Next.js + Firestore + Gemini 2.0 Flash)
- ✅ Coding style guide (TypeScript, React patterns, Tailwind CSS)
- ✅ Project context document (mission, status, tech stack)
- ✅ `.gitignore` configuration for Next.js/Firebase projects

```

### Key Decisions
- **BYU Campus as pilot** — Team is on-campus, tight-knit community, service-oriented culture
- **Flyer scanning as MVP focus** — Gemini 2.0 Flash provides 30x cost advantage
- **No user accounts in MVP** — Reduces friction, anonymous browsing
- **Human-in-the-loop AI verification** — Prevents "ghost chase" errors
- **Serverless architecture** — Vercel + Firebase for zero DevOps
