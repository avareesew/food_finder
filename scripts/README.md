# Scripts

Utility scripts for development, deployment, and maintenance tasks.

## Planned Scripts

- `setup.sh` - Initialize local development environment
- `seed-data.sh` - Populate database with test data
- `deploy.sh` - Deploy to production (if needed beyond Vercel auto-deploy)
- `backup.sh` - Backup Firestore data

Scripts will be added as needed during development.
